## Shooting Stars ðŸŒ 

This project is a recreation of a code from code pen. It was a good way to work with classes, arrays, events, and some game dev concepts.

It was easier to break the project into different parts and go from there

- Create canvas and give its properties, as well as the resize method
- Create the all the classes I was going to use
- Create the static objects (stars and mountains)
- Create the shooting star and give its logic to shrink in size and disappear from the canvas
- Create the particles shown on screen when the star hit the ground
  and give its logic for when they should disappear

The tricky part for me in this project was managed the arrays element so they don't have too much elements in them as well as removing the right items in the right time

The Final Result
